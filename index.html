          When I stopped believing in friendships my best friend came into my life.<br><br>
          When I met her, she was talkative and I was a bit shy, but gradually I realized that even though we have different personalities, there's always something we share in common. Maybe it's the way we appreciate each other in big and small things, or maybe the way we're both passionate about our dreams.<br><br>
          I hope she knows she has the most beautiful heart, that she's the best person I've ever known. She has eyes full of dreams, and I wish she gets everything she needs. She's kind, gorgeous, and the one who never gives up.<br><br>
          She made me believe in friendship, and I hope she stays my best friend forever.
